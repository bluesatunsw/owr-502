# Common electrical symbol and footprint library

*a.k.a. the "Bluesat" symbol and footprint libraries*

These are KiCad 9 symbols and footprints for components used across multiple
different boards that aren't part of the KiCad standard library. These are
components that are stocked in the [electrical
inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Fax9CmlFEk7mBak5Owge5LxEZH7rAfaMM2YBqbKku0/edit?usp=sharing).
Use these symbols and footprints if they exist to save making your own symbols
and footprints for our components.
