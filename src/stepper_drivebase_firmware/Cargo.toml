# Enable exactly one of the below features! Only the first enabled feature below will apply.

# The Quad Stepper Driver board is naturally this firmware's target hardware, and it uses the STM32G474.
# Firmware should be exact same across the hardware revisions, but we can't be 100% sure yet (-:
# Do try to flash the correct firmware onto the correct hardware!

# The WeAct board is just an STM32G431 dev board for development/prototyping only.
