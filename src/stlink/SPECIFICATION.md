# STLink Specification
STLINK-V3MINIE

## Purpose
Allows us to use Serial Wire Debug on our boards.
Don't have to do jank thing with the jumpers.

## Description
Should connect this board to our ribbon cables (see the 6 pin IPC on the main board spec).

Can't easily be done with just a connector - ribbon cables aren't exactly easy to crimp.
