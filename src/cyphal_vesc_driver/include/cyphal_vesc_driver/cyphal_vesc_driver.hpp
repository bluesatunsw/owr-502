/*
 * UNCONFIGURED (on_init, on_cleanup):
 *   Hardware is initialized but communication is not started and therefore no interface is
 *available.
 *
 * INACTIVE (on_configure, on_deactivate):
 *   Communication with the hardware is started and it is configured.
 *   States can be read, but command interfaces are not available.
 *
 * FINALIZED (on_shutdown):
 *   Hardware interface is ready for unloading/destruction.
 *   Allocated memory is cleaned up.
 *
 * ACTIVE (on_activate):
 *   Power circuits of hardware are active and hardware can be moved, e.g., brakes are disabled.
 *   Command interfaces are available.
