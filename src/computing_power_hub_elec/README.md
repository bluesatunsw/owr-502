# Computing Power Hub (CPH)

A device which provides and monitors regulated rails for communications (passive 24V POE), computing (19V), cameras (12V) and lighting (5V) devices. It complies with the common device specification 2025-04.

## Switching
Output to each rail can be switched.

## Monitoring
The output current and voltage of each rail is monitored.

## Rail Generation
The 19V, 12V and 5V rails are generated by TPS54560 buck regulators (designs documented with Excel spreadsheets from TI). Each of these rails should be able to deliver 5A. A TPS61175 regulator is used to generate the 24V 1A POE rail.

The high current 5V and 12V rails replace the regular rails in the common device specification.

## Connection
Power input for the CPH is provided via a male XT30 connector. The 19V and 12V rails are output to 2-pin JST VH headers, limited to 5A and 4A respectively. LED power is sent to four ARGB (WS2812) ports with a 3-pin JST PA header, limited to 1A each.

The board has a pair of RJ45 sockets, the Ethernet signal is passed between these ports with a POE power injected into one of the ports.
