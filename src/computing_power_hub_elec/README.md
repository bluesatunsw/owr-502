# Computing Power Hub (CPH)

A device which provides and monitors regulated rails for communications (passive 24V POE), computing (12V) and lighting (5V) devices. It complies with the common device specification 2025-04.

## Switching
Power to each of the channels can be toggled by the MCU. When a channel is enabled, including when the device initially powers up, a soft start slowly reduces the output impedance to reduce inrush current. As implied by their names, each channel is able to output 30A peak and 20A continuous.

## Monitoring
The output current and voltage of each rail is monitored.

## Rail Generation
The 5V and 12V rails are generated by a pair of TPS54560 buck regulators. Each of these rails should be able to deliver 5A. A TPS61175 regulator is used to generate the 24V 1A POE rail.

The high current 5V and 12V rails replace the regular rails in the common device specification.

## Connection
Power input for the CPH is provided via a male XT30 connector. The 12V rail is output to a 2-pin JST VH header, limited to 3A. LED power is sent to four ARGB (WS2812) ports with a 3-pin JST PA header, limited to 1A each.

The board has a pair of RJ45 sockets, the Ethernet signal is passed between these ports with a POE power injected into one of the ports.
