## Useful Command index
| Command                                                               | Effect                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------                                       | --------------------------------                                                                |
| `podman compose -f "$PWD/.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml" up -d`     | Run in the git root to build/restart/start the Docker container.                                |
| `podman compose -f "$PWD/.devcontainer/docker-compose-obc.yml" up -d` | Run in the git root to build/restart/start the Docker container **with obc specific settings!** |
| `podman exec -it --latest /bin/bash`                                  | Enter the docker container after launching it with the devcontainer.                            |
| `./utils/init.bash`                                                   | Run after `cd`'ing into `/workspaces/owr-502` in the container to source the ROS env and tools  |
| `colcon build --symlink-install`                                      | Runs the `colcon` meta build system, builds ALL rover packages!                                 |
| `ros2 launch rover rover.launch.py`                                   | Launch the robot state publisher. Just leave this running.                                      |
| `rqt`                                                                 | The flexible ROS2 viewer, useful for debugging topic flows and looking at raw topics.           |
| `rviz2`                                                               | Useful for visualizing TF2 / LiDAR / etc... data to see if it looks okay.                       |
| `podman rm --force --latest -t 0`                                     | Kill the podman container with the latest creation date (quickly)                               |

NOTE: `podman compose` will take a VERY long time! on uni Wi-Fi \~5min due to
the amount of packages it installs (\~5GB). There is also [a podman
bug](github.com/containers/podman/issues/16541) that invokes a postprocessing
step on the overlay filesystem, this will take **upwards of 10 minutes!** 

NOTE: `./utils/init.bash` will source the appropriate files as well as put you
in a 10-deep nested shell - running an invalid command will kill 1 level!
